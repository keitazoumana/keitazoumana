### Hi there 👋
My name is 
# Zoumana Keita

- ⚡ Previously I worked as Machine Learning Engineer at [Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.fr/) for a couple of weeks before moving to the US for my Master in Business & Data Science at [Texas Tech University, Rawls College of Business](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rawlsbusiness/). Before that, I was Data Scientist for 2 years at [Axionable](https://www.axionable.com/), first Sustainable AI startup in France and Canada. Also I spent 2 years and 6 months at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr) as Machine Learning Consultant. 
- ❤️ I love Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Cloud Computing & MLOps
- 🩺 What keeps me in shape 
  -  When I was in France, I had Taekwondo classes 🥋 on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday & Saturday at [Mudo Club Argenteuil](https://www.mudoclubargenteuil.fr/)
  -  Daily morning runner 🏃🏾
  -  Occasional football player ⚽️ with friends 
  -  Attiéké, Yassa, Mafé, Thieb, etc. 😋 
- 🌱 I’m addicted to continuous learning, which makes me grow on a regular basis
- 🌏 I'm sharing my knowledge through my blog in order to make good impact on others life
